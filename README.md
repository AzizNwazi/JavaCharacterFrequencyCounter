Character Frequency Counter

This Java program takes an input text from the user and calculates the frequency of each character in the text. It uses a TreeMap to store the frequency of each character, where the characters are sorted in natural order. Here's how it works:

Input:

The program prompts the user to enter a text.
It reads the input text using a Scanner.
Frequency Calculation:

It iterates over each character in the input text.
For each character, it checks if it already exists in the frequency map.
If the character is present, it increments its count in the map.
If the character is not present, it adds it to the map with a count of 1.
Output:

After calculating the frequency of each character, it displays the result.
It prints each character along with its frequency in the format: "Character : <char> appeared <count> times"
This program serves as a basic demonstration of how to calculate and display the frequency of characters in a given text using Java.
